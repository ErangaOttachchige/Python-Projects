# Unpacking


coordinates = (1,2,3) #Tuple (immutable)

# x = coordinates[0]
# y = coordinates[1]
# z = coordinates[2]


x, y, z = coordinates  # this is exactly identical to what we have on lines 2-4
# we are unpacking the tuple in to these variables

print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

# we can use this feature in list[] as well.
